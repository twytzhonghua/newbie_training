	Today is Friday, it became sunny. I also
get good mood when Friday, because the weekends
become near. But I don't feel very pleased to
meet the weekends, I get used to the life of
work.
	Today is the second day of IDL new members 
training, in these two weeks, I have to part
my time to attend it, then I get little time
in working. 
	These days I don't pay much time on learning
kernel driver, I spend most time on Android, I
think I get a little blindness, because I don't
find a proper way of learning it. Then I must
get down to my study.
	Still water run deep, I still stick to working
hardheadedly.
