	Today is Friday, sunny. 
	Time flows in no feel, every day when I
go back home from work, I feel that it just
like time goes by between a blink, I usually 
can't find how it goes by so quickly.
	These days I keep studying how to create
node under /dev in real Android device, and I 
encounter some problems. I realize that I should
be adapt to get useful information in big project,
and grasp basic knowledge of linux driver.
	Come on!
