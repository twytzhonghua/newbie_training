	Today is Monday, sunny and hot.
	After last cool weekends, I think we all 
enjoyed the weekends, the rain in the weekends was 
really timely rain.
	These days we  care for the airplane 
crashed in San Francisco America, a sad thing is 
that two Chinese girl died in the accident. What 
a sad thing! They were in youth time.
	Now a saying is that one girlwas killed
by the rescue machine, what an angry things.
Maybe our country is not enough strong, Chinese 
people don't get enough respected.
	Young strong, China strong. Come on!
