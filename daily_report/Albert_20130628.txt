	Today is Friday, a little rainy. 
	At the end of this month, my first phase 
of training is going to be end. I tried hard
to study the knowledge in the training tests,
and my learning state is better than before, 
maybe because I haven't get rid of the approach to
learn in school. 
	After about three month of work, I think I 
have got used to working, and my learning method
gradually changed. And I think I have got some 
progress this week.
	I will keep good state of work to grow
up faster.
