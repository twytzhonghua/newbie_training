	Today is Monday, the first day of July, sunny,
a little hot. It seems like if it doesn't rain, the
weather is very hot. Maybe because it is hot summer.
	Today I tried to get some gpios' value, but the

	Debugging is a headache thing, the most depressing
thing is that you don't know where to debug. So we should
have an orderly mind.
	Everyone has limited energy, so we should keep good
status to accomplish our work efficiently. A good habit is 
very important.
