	Today is Friday, sunny. This Wednesday is May
Day, we just got one day for rest, after two days, the
weekends come again.
	In this weekdays, I think I didn't learn too
much knowledge. Maybe I do discontinuity of work.
	In ancient war, the army adviser usually thought
it is important that end the war at one fling.
	Sometimes, when I encounter some problems, I 
just want to handle it in a quiet environment for a long 
time until it's solved. When I solve it, I usually get 
a sense of very comfortable.
	Every cloud has a silver lining!
