	Today is Tuesday, rainy in the morning, maybe because it
rained, the traffic became traffic jams on my way to work. I 
kept being worried about to be late for work. At last I arrived
at the company about twenty-five past eight, what a breathtaking
morning it was. 
	Almost late for work, I should reschedule my time in rainy 
days. 
	Today I continued learning some knowledge of "concurrency and
race", and I find it's becoming more and more interesting in 
learning linux device drivers. I will keep working hard to be an 
excellent driver software engineer.
