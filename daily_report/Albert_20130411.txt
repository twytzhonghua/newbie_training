	Today is Thursday, the weather is hot. It's easier 
to make people feel tired in this season. The daytime 
becomes longer, it means we have less time for the sleep
durning the night. So we should take a break at noon in 
order to get enough energy to work in the afternoon.
	All the day, I continued studying the Linux drivers.
As a result, I mastered how to call functions of module with
application, and swapping data between kernel and user space.
	I find some functions are more interesting in writting 
kernel drivers, I will keep this passion on studying kernel 
drivers.
