	Today is Tuesday, hot, very hot, especially
in rush hour, the outside temperture gets higher
about 37. If it winds, something gets better.
    Today I found that my way of reading the
the gpios' vaule was error, because I read all
gpios' value, the result stayed the same. I thought
I should find another method to overcome the question.
So I searched some useful codes in the Mango source codes
all the morning, about at noon, I got some useful
information, and found out the reason. Because this cpu
is too new that the linux kernel didn't define relevant
registers and GPIOs, they defined them by themselves.
    Search the useful information in the large source
codes is important, and necessary. I should develop good
habits and skills of searching useful information in source 
codes.
