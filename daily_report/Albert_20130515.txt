	Today is Thursday, windy. In morning, it was
sunny, but after noon, it got windy. The weather
forecast said it will keep rainy in this three
days. As the weather becomes bad, maybe more people 
will be late for work compare with sunny days.
	In these days for new IDL training, I learned 
some knowledge that is important for work, such 
as work should follow SOP, the skill of filling in
the form and writing E-mail, and so on. 
	Yesterday a teacher told us a lot about how to
cultivate our added value, and taught us to do
anything from my start, and you should see some
thing by your heart so that you could get the 
result.
	It is really right that do anything by heart!
