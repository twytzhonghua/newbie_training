	Today is Thursday, sunny. 
	Yesterday is the Dragon Boat Festivalï¼Œthe festival 
is to venerate Qu Yuan, because the great poet jumped 
into river to suicide for his home country. He was a 
patriotic poet, that's why people later followed the 
customs such as dragon boat racing, eating zongzi and 
drinking realgar wine in the lunar May 5.
	After one day of rest, I come back to work. Every
day is so calm, I am getting some anxiety, nearly about
two months pasted quickly, I still can't make great 
progress in study and work. I have to speed up learning
to be a member of bear on the work as soon as possible.
