	Today is Thursday, yesterday is May Day, we
had a rest. Yesterday my second sister went to Kunshan
from Suzhou, She didn't come to my elder sister's home 
for half month. 
	The last time, she came here to go fishing with
us, durning the half month, she was very eager to go 
fishing.
	The day before yesterday, she came here, and we
started off early in the next morning. The weather was 
very fine for fishing, not cold, not hot. As a result, we 
harvested 128 fish. It's really exciting.
	It is really a good start, come on.
