	Today is Monday, hot.
	A new week comes with hot weather, it makes
us feel uncomfortable. When we stood in queue
to wait for the shuttle bus, the sunshine was too
strong that most colleagues sweated.
	As it gets hotter, I will not have good chance
to go fishing, after I came back from school to 
work, I haven't enjoyed myself from fishing, and I 
hope it gets cool at weekends.
	Today I learned how to test the new image on the
android device, and grasped the basic skills in
test image.
	I know there are still too many things waiting 
for me to do, hurry up!
