	Today is Thursday, the weather still keeps very hot.
In the morning, I continued to analysis the bluetooth
address from Mango sources code according to the log.
Firstly, I didn't adapt to view codes in large-scale 
project, the function's relationship is so complicated.
But in the end, I find some useful information, it reads
some data from driver device. 
	I thought I should find the driver source codes to 
analysis and give out the result. Then I encountered a 
problem, I found out the node's name, but couldn't find
the source name. Find out useful information in large
codes is so important, keep clear thinking, I think
I will get the result in the short run.
