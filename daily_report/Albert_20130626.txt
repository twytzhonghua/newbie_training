	Today is Wednesday, sunny in the morning, and it 
became cloudy later. 
	Time flew quickly, especially when I am debugging 
the program, I find some samples in kernel, and there 
are some differences between them and char drivers. I 
tried several times to transplant the source codes to 
my char driver codes, when I tried to insmod  the module, 
the oops occurred.  
	With time goes by, I should speed up to finish 
the first phase of training the sooner the better.
	Just go for the target. Come on!
