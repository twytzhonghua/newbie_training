	Today is Thursday, it lasts rainy. The air
became fresher, but the traffic became bad in
yesterday and today's morning.
	The time of going back to school comes near, 
I suddenly get some feeling uneasy. In school,
my classmates are busying in writing graduation
thesis, we regard it as the last examination,
and we will never take an examination any more
in the college.
	I think most students pay more energy on
working it than any other examinations, every
member want to draw a complete full stop at the
end of college. If you do well, you will get
good sweet memories.
	Time wait for nobody, just make full use of
it!
