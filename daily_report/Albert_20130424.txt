	Today is Wensday, it become sunny, the air is very 
fresh, so I breathe comfortably, it's a nice day.
	These days, we are focusing on the Ya'an earthquake,
it's magnitude 7 earthquake. It is strange that it occured
in Sichuan province too, in 2008, Wenchuan earthquake had
caused great damage. It's easy to let us feel that our 
country is a multiplicity of disaster country.
	We strongly renerved from Wenchuan earthquake , now 
our national people unite as one, Ya'an will renerved 
quickly. Let's pray for Ya'an.
