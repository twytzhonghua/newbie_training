	Today is Tuesday, it is cooler than yesterday. After a 
good rest last night, I feel much better than yesterday.
There is so much knowledge waiting for me to learn, I have 
to improve myself control ability, and distribute the time 
of work and rest time more reasonable.
	As the saying goes: A plan may not be able to keep up 
with changes. It usually goes for studying, I shoud study 
hard according to the training plan, and remember the old
saying: Today and tomorrow, how many tomorrow!
	Revolution has not yet succeeded, comrade still needs 
work hard. Come on!
