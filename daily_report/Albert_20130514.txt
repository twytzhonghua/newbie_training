	Today is Tuesday, hot. 
	When it gets hotter and hotter in summer, I 
usually remember that when I was in middle or 
high school, in holidays or  weekends I usually 
went to filed to help parents do farm work. When
it was near noon, the air got very hot, and we
all expected cool wind. 
	Now after several years, I usually remember
that my parents were so laborious to support 
us to study in schools, and we all went to college
after graduated from high school, so that my elder
sisters and me don't have to do physical labor to
feed ourselves. I appreciate them very much, I must 
work and study hard in order to make a better future.
