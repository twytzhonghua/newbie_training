	Today is Monday, the first day of this week, the 
weather is windy, the weather forecast says it will rain
last servel days this week.
	Now, I doesn't trust in the weather forecast any
more, because it doesn't become ture accurately. Last 
Saturday, the forecast said  it would rain, then I didn't
decided to go fishing, then I got up I found it was so 
cool, then we went fishing, but the weather was so hot,
we got even a little burned for the strong sunshine.
	Today I learn how to create node under /proc,
I find some sample in the kernel about the usage of
create_proc(), then I try to insert the function in
my old codes, and it work it out.
