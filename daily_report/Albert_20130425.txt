	Today is Thursday, sunny, a bit hot. I feel I get
more presure and task than before, because I have to 
learn the knowledge of android and java. From now on,
I will pay more energy to study and make full use of 
work time.
	April is going to an end, May is coming soon. Suddenly
I remember that I'm going back to school to handle my
graduation oral examination, it means my college career is
coming to an end. How time flies,  I usually dreams about 
the learning days with classmates.
	Cherish every minute of life, come on!
