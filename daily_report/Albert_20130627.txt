	Today is Thursday, rainy. The weather forecast 
become true, it rains all the day.
	Today I continued learning how to create nodes under
/sys, and worked it out. I am very happy that I 
finished it finally. Suddenly I find it is so important
to master the skills of finding information in kernel
source codes. The kernel provide some documents to 
help the developers and the information is very precious,
it is the most direct way to get the things you need.
	"The kernel is an art", some one says, I think it 
is similar to the calligraphy, only you master the 
details, you can understand what's behind it and use 
it skillfully.
