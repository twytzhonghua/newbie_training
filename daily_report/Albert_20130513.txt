	Today is Monday, a new workdays begin, we all 
come back from weekends. 
	Some may get full energy from two days of rest. 
But some  may feel a little tired. In college, some 
got up late for a long sleep, some students got early
to play basketball or go traveling. 
	I remember in school we usually went to bed late 
in the night when it was weekends, and the living 
habits didn't grew well, so after weekends, most may 
feel a little tired when in class.
	Now I form good habits gradually, I order me to 
sleep before ten o'clock pm, and get up before six 
thirty, and I feel getting better physical and mental
state to face up to work.
	Good habits makes all things easy!
