	Today is Thursday, it becomes a bit cold suddenly. 
Maybe because it got cloudy, I felt a bit of pressure.
All the day I kept debugging the device driver, and 
didn't get much progress. 
	When at college, teacher said you would pay
most of time on debugging program in a project, at 
first I didn't understand it is fact. Durning these
days of learning char device driver I deeply perceived 
that a rigorous way of thingking is so important.
	Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets
his mind to do it. Be more careful, evidence of 
persistence, only in this way we can save twists and 
turns.
