	Today is Monday, a new week begins. After last weekends of 
rest, we may feel more energico. It is near May day, we will 
get one more day for rest, the weather becomes hotter, the hot
summer is comming.
	People always say spring is the season of a sleepy, but I 
think it is also in summer. After March 21, the direct sunlight
point moves north, we get more daytime and sunshine. Until the
summer solstice on June 21, the direct sunlight point doesn't 
move north, it begins move south. It means it gets closer to
June 21, the weather gets hotter, daytime gets longer.
	Because of hot, people may waste more power and energy, and
the daytime is longer than night. Have a nap at noon, get a 
efficient worktime.
