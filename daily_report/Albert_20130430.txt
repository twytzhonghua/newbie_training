	Today is Tuseday, After it rained a lot last night, it
got hotter.
	Sometimes, when it blows, I usually fancy that flowers
are blown down on the ground at night, and in the next morning 
you will see petals on the ground and wetted by rain. What a nice 
scenery full of poetic! If the air flows the smell of earth, it 
gets nicer.
	Today I began learning the android knowledge, and I 
successfully wrote a application program contains picture and
texts, and made it run on my telephone device. I think it is more
interesting than linux device driver, maybe because the interface 
is more affluent.
	Learning is a interesting thing, at the same time you can
harvest a lot.
