	Today is Friday, it is still hot. Tommorow is 
weekends, and a busy and substantial weekdays  is over.
we will have two days for a rest. How I hope that this
weekends will be cool not like these days that are so
hot. If my wish becomes true, I'll go fishing with my 
sisters and elder brother in law,too.
	Today I spent almost all my worktime on learning the
linked list of C program. I feel a little difficult, as 
I never used it before. Through studying this knowledge,
I realize that linked list is superior than Structure 
Array in using RAM.
	Tomorrow is another day, come on!
