	Today is Tuesday, cloudy.
	When I left home to go work in the morning, my elder
sister reminded me carry along an umbrella, it turned
out to be she was right. Near five o'clock, it became
very cloudy, and it is unavoidable to rain heavily.
	Today I learned some knowledge of how to create
nodes under /sys, I found the source codes in the kernel,
and learnt the relevant function useage. Step by step,
I find it is not so difficult to learn the strange device
driver, the kernel show so many samples all kinds of functions
usage, we can refer these sources, so it become easier to
do the relevant work.
