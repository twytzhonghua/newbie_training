	Today is Monday, rainy. When I was waiting 
for the bus, it became a little cloudy, then
it rained in the morning. The air becomes fresh,
and my mood gets better.
	Today I continued learning the knowledge of
Android, and felt a bit pressure, because I am
not familiar with the Android APIs and the Java
language. 
	Through about a month of working, I find that
I am becoming to like studying from heart, I am
eager to do linux device driver work independently
the sooner the better.
