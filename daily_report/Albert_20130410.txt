	Today is Wednesday, the weather is even hotter than yesterday.
About ten o'clock, we attended the weekly meeting. At the meeting, 
I realized our department's working process and colleagues's task.
I extremely admire colleagues always work so well, they can do 
so many works.
	I should study hard and consult colleagues in time, so that 
I can make faster progress. 
	Today I continued learning the linux drivers, and I should study
it step by step according to the plan. The studying way ahead is 
long, I see no ending, yet high and low I'll search with my will
unbending.
