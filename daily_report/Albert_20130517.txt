	Today is Friday, rainy. Today is my last day
of internship before graduation.
	Now my mood gets complex. I will go back to 
school by train at today's night, and arrive at
school in the next morning.
	After about half and a month, I think I learned
too much knowledge, even more than one term in school
in practice. And I find I like to work, I feel very 
enrich in work time. 
	I really be grateful to all that help me so much in 
life and work, and I like this work very much, and I 
will work hard to become a full member as soon as 
possible and get the ability of working independently.
	Everything comes to him who waits, come on!
