	Today is Wednesday, the weather got hotter than yesterday 
in the morning, at afternoon it became a little cloudy, the weather forecast 
said it would rain today, we are waiting for the rain to get cooler
in such hot weather.
	I usually remember the day we were in college in English class
, the teacher gave us some time to give a short morning speech on
the rostrum. At that time, only a small number students take an active 
in doing the speech, later teacher made a plan to give everyone a chance
to do speech according to the student id.
	Through listening classmates' speech, we learned more about our
classmates that we got little contact.
	Now after leaving school, we miss the days we stay together to
study and live. The road ahead is long, I will think about the past
on the way.
