	Today is Thursday, hot.
	I continued to learn another way to get the
result that I kept looking for. I remembered 
the way of operating the registers when I studied
the ARM SOC, and I searched some information of
converting the physical address to virtual address,
in linux kernel, ioremap function can work it out.
	So I inserted the second way of reading registers'
value and get the relevant bit value of gpio. At last,
the result stayed the same with before.
	Like supervisor said, we should get the ability of 
understand the hardware circuit diagram, when we 
communicate with hardware engineer, it become easier.
