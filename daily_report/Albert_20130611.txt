	Today is Tuesday, cloudy.
	After a short stay of three weeks in school,
I come back to work. In those days of school, we
couldn't keep silent, before the oral defense for graduation 
most students all were busying writing thesis and debugging
procedure. 
	But after handled graduation thesis over, we all 
played happily or crazy, some play cards and paste thin 
paper on face, and after several rounds, someone's face 
would be full of paper, it was so lovely.
	Those days of life was the most happy days in my 
university, when it was near leaving school, most students
were feel sad, we didn't want to leave the school that
we had studied and lived for four years.
	When I leaved school and went to Kunshan by train, my 
heart was complex. But when I went to work, I feel very
calm. 
	Now I have to keep busy and study hard to  make up for 
the lost days in school.
