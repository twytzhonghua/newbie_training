	Today is Tuesday, still hot.
	These days I still keep learning how to create
node under /dev on Mango, and doesn't get much progress.
After discussed this issue in the meeting agenda, 
colleagues gave some good advice, and I tried it with 
this advice, then Mango booted successfully.
	Last weekend I saw a movie named "American dreams in
China", it told a story about three friends start their
business. After saw this movie, I thought it gave us more
courage and self-confident in our job and career. And gave
us the revelation that we should cherish the friendship, 
because when you encounter difficulties, friends will 
lend you a hand in due course.
