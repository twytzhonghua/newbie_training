	Today is Friday, the end of this weekday, a little hot.
	With the hot summer coming, I remember that it was hot
four years ago after the college entrance examination, too.
After the examination we had about three months' holidays, 
In order to make the long summer vacation meaningful, I 
bought several brush calligraphy books, then I began my
studying brush calligraphy life. 
	In those three months, I fell in love with the Chinese calligraphy slowly, my grandpa and father are good at calligraphy,
they made good and big effect on me, and at college, I kept
practicing it, and I usually communicated with the enthusiasts or
calligrapher from school and society.
	It is really one thing that be worth to stick to a lifetime,
I will inist on doing it all my life.
