	Today is Monday, two days of weekends passed quickly. All 
of a sudden it's turn to work, I feel a bit of tired. We
go fishing on Saturday and Sunday, we got up early about at five 
o'clock in the morning. The weather was cool in the morning,
when we arrived at the destination, we get full energy, and started 
fishing right away. As a result, we got good harvest, what a happy
weekends it was. Maybe because of getting up too early in the two days,
I got a little tired.
	Durning fishing, when I lifted the fishing rod, sometimes the 
wind blowed my fishing wire in wild disorder. Because of the fishing 
wire is very slender, it's difficult to unlock it. Throngh unfastening
the massed wire, I found that it is very similar to the  debugging program.
	A funny and tired weekends have passed, I should pay my attention
on my studying and working.
