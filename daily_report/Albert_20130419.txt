	Today is Friday, weekends are coming. What a happy thing
it is. From yesterday on, the weather becomes cloudy and windy,
so I am afraid it lasts bad tomorrow and damage my plan for 
fishing. 
	All this work days, my nerves keeps tighten, because I really
get pressure from studying. Maybe it is necessary to have a good 
rest to release pressure. If it gets better tomorrow, I will go 
fishing too.
	Today I solved all the question of singly linked list, and felt
relaxed a lot. Studying is not very esay thing, but when you solve 
all the bugs, you will feel sweet too. I will keep working hard 
in next work days. Success belongs to persevering, come on!
