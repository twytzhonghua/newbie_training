	Today is Friday, hot. Every Friday I always feel a
bit excited, it is the same as we wait for holidays in 
school. I remember that when it's Friday, all of students 
pay no attention on studying, particularly at afternoon, 
the only one thing we wish and waiting for is the school 
bell rings.
	In college, we have more holidays than in Senior high
school, we get losinig the interest in waiting for school
bell rings.
	Now, I begin my first job, and I really like this job 
vrey much. It makes me feel more responsibility rather than
at school, I should do my best to work better and better.
