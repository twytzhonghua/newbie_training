	Today is Friday, windy, cooler than yesterday,
the weather forecast says it will rain tomorrow.
If it rains really, I'll be so happy to enjoy the
weekends. 
	These days the news media report the CCTV host
Wanghuan died because of cancer. Wanghuan's name was
Wangwei in her childhood, because she was too sickï¼Œ 
so she changed a happier name called Wangwei. Just 
like her name, she is very lively.
	On the other hand, the news give us one information:
a healthy body is so important. If not, you have no
energy to do the meaningful things.
	The body is the capital, develop good living habits,
strive to be a positive people.
