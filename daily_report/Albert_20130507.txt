	Today is Tuesday, sunny. The work days doesn't
change much, I find I an accustomed to the work. 
Work becomes a common thing in my life not like 
that we usually had too much freedom in school, but
you can harvest a lot.
	Elapses days were dead, the time which we only can
control is now, is today, though people always say
"Tomorrow is another day!", I don't agree that put one's
all hope in tomorrow. Because we seize now, why don't
make full use of the current time we are owning.
	It is the season of graduation, I usually see some
information about my classmates's life in school from 
Internet, get kinds of complicated mood.
	Grasping today and make the tomorrow!
