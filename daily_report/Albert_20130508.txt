	Today is Wednesday, rainy. Last night I didn't 
get good rest, maybe these days I encountered some 
problems, and I paid much energy on solving them,
then I couldn't fall asleep quickly.
	After about a month of working, I find that my
way of life changed a lot. In school, we usually
get up at about seven o'clock in the morning, when
there are no classes, we will sleep late until about
ten o'clock, through we go to class, we also will feel
very freedom. 
	Now, I get up early about half past six in the 
morning, and go to wait bus before a quarter past
seven. Then in work time, I find much knowledge
I have to learn, and I concentrate on studying. And
I think I harvest so much knowledge.
	Keep correct attitude, stick it out!
