	Today is Monday, a new week begins, it's time for working and 
studying. The weather became so cold about five degree in the 
morning and windy and rainy last Saturday, so that it was bad 
time to go outside, such as go fishing. I got up so early in 
the morning on last Saturday, as a result it let me down.
	On Sunday, I still got up early, but it got better, we went
fishing gladly. I got only half days of weekends to go fishing, 
and didn't enjoy myself to the full, and felt it very short 
weekend. 
	In rest time, play happily. Concentrate on working and learning
at work days, I like to schedule time like this. Every day is a 
new beginning, come on!
