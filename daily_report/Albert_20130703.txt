	Today is Wednesday, a little cooler than yesterday.
	Last night, I chatted with some of  my classmates,
I got some miss of them, when I hear that they find 
a proper job, I feel very happy. Before we graduated 
from school, most students didn't go out school or find
a job of practical training. 
	When I graduated from school, suddenly I find out that
I hadn't got too much knowledge in college classes, or the 
knowledge in textbook is difference from the work. I feel
very fortunate that I can do the work I like, and it has 
some relationship with my professional in college.
	Through the chat, I found I had some gap with some 
classmates, some have got great progress in our major, 
and I felt a little pressure, so I should learn more to catch
up with them.
