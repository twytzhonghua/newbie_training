	Today is Thursday, rainy. It become true
that some colleagues be late for work. I was
near be late for work, too. 
	When I arrived at the dormitory to wait
for shuttle bus, there were so many people 
were standing in queue, I was so surprised 
that there were so many people, this phenomenon
which I never seen before about this time in
the morning. The shuttle buses didn't arrived
in time that caused us to be late for work.
	Tomorrow night I will go back to school,
and I will cherish the time in school before 
graduation.
