	Today is Wednesday, the weather become cooler, it's 
really a good time for fishing. Half of weekdays have 
passed, the weekends will become soon. There is something
that I still worry about, the task I have not finished. 
I wish I could finish all the rest of the task in order to 
play without uneasy at weekends.
	Today I continued studying the char device driver, 
step by step, I learned how to fill the function, and use
the function parameter such as loff_t *offset, struct file
*filp and so on. I gradually I find it's more and more 
interesting to write and debug char device drivers.
	Time and tide wait for no man, hurry up!
