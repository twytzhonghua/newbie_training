	Today is Thursday, a little cooler than yesterday.
	I suddenly find out that when I go back to work from
school, I don't pay so much time on go fishing. Maybe the 
weather is not proper for fishing. This two weekends it was
hot or rainy, and I am a bit complain about the bad weather.
	Today my second elder sister said she wil come here 
to go fishing with us at this weekend, and she spent much time 
on learning the fishing skills through the internet.
	She send me some skills, I scaned it and thought it
is described resonable. Fishing is a funny thing, if I grasp
some skills, I will get good harvest. It's a funny thing that 
like kill two birds with one stone.
