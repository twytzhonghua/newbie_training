	Today is Tuesday, sunny, a bit hot outside, maybe summer is comming.
    In theses days, durning studying time I get a bit of studying
pressure. Today I learned some basic knowledge of system call, such as 
creat(), open(), read(), close(), fopen(),fputs(),fgets(), fclose() and
so on.
	Although it is a little difficult for me in the future, my heart 
is full of energy to face up to study Linux Device Drivers, I am going to
find something interesting in it.
