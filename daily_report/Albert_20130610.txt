	Today is Monday, windy. 
	Two days ago, high school students were attending
	the national college entrance examination all over
the country. At the same time, We were attending the 
University graduation ceremony on the playground in 
our school.
	Coincidently, four years ago, we were doing the 
same thing that the high school students did. On the
contrary, we were going to leave college, however they
were making efforts to go to a better college.
	How time flies, four years' college life is over, 
all of us have to find a proper job to feed ourselves 
and get a good future.
